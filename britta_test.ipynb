    "We converted the nominal (or discrete) inputs to numeric values using a simple quantization: if an input x may take discrete values {v1,...,vn}, when it takes the discrete value vi it is converted to the numeric value i ∈ {1,...,n}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each input is pre-processed to have zero mean and standard deviation one,as isusual intheclassifier literature.We do not use further pre-processing, data transformation or feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The validation methodology is the following. One training and one test set are generated randomly (each with 50% of the available patterns), but imposing that each class has the same number of training and test patterns (in order to have enough training and test patterns of every class). This couple of sets is used only for parameter tuning (in those classifiers which have tunable parameters), selecting the parameter values which provide the best accuracy on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, using the selected values for the tunable parameters, a 4-fold cross validation is developed using the whole available data. The test results is the average over the 4 test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, for some data sets, which provide separate data for training and testing (data sets annealing and audiology-std, among others), the classifier (with the tuned parameter values) is trained and tested on the respective data sets. In this case, the test result is calculated on the test set."
